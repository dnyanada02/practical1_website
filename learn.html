            <p>The HyperText Markup Language, or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser.HTML elements are the building blocks of<br> HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page.

            <h1>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets )</h1>
            <p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as HTML. CSS is designed to enable <br>the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and fonts. This separation can improve content accessibility, provide more flexibility and control in the specifi-<br>cation of presentation characteristics, enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file which reduces complexity and repetit-<br>ion in the structural content as well as enabling the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.</p>

JavaScript is high-level,often just-in-time compiled,and multi-paradigm. <br>It has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. As a multi-paradigm language, JavaScript supports event-driven, functional, <br>and imperative programming styles. It has application programming interfaces ( APIs ) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document <br>Object Model (DOM).</p>
